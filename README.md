# ðŸ“˜ ReMemorize â€“ Quiz App for Personal Learning

## Why Iâ€™m building this

I was inspired by Kevenâ€”not by his project, but by his idea that we should **build something meaningful to ourselves** rather than just follow tutorials. It made me pause and ask:

> **Why did I start this course in the first place?**

The answer came from one of Phil's videos. He talked about how building something that relates to your own life gives you the motivation to **push through and truly learn**.

As I reflected on that, I realized it's easy to **forget the little things** I learn in each course sectionâ€”especially if I donâ€™t revisit them regularly. Thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m building **ReMemorize**:  
A simple quiz app where I can store useful takeaways and practice them any time.

Each time I take a quiz, itâ€™s like placing another **brick in my foundation of knowledge**.
