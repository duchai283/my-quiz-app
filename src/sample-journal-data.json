    "question": "What is closure?",
    "answer": "A closure in JavaScript is when a function remembers the variables from where it was created, even if that outer function has already finished running.\n\nFor example, if I define a function inside another function, and return it, that inner function can still access the outer function’s variables.\n\nImagine you have a function that creates a counter. Each time you call the inner function, it increases the count and remembers that value because of the closure.\n\nIt’s useful for things like private variables, making counters, or function factories.",
